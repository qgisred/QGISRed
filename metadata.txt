about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a freeware QGIS plugin developed to assist in building and analyzing hydraulic models of water distribution networks of any complexity, up to the level of detail required by Digital Twins. The plugin works seamlessly with QGIS which enables the user to georeference all network elements, use geographic background layers, edit graphical and alphanumerical data, use geoprocessing tools, visualize data by layers, customize the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed relies on an easy-to-use relational database of SHP and DBF files based on the EPANET data model. In case the user decides to use the QGIS tools to edit the data, QGISRed provides powerful facilities to detect potential editing errors before simulating the model, or to fill in the missing information.</p><p align="justify">In addition, QGISRed provides numerous tools to help building hydraulic models, to manage demand scenarios and to analyse the results without the need to use the QGIS environment, such as:</p><li>Project manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Creation of new empty projects</li><li>Creation of a project backup</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files</li><li>Import basic network components from Shapefiles and other auxiliary components managed by the Digital Twin (DT) such as service connections. Shortly also isolated valves, meters, hydrants, purge valves, etc.</li><li>Automatic generation of topological relationships between all the network elements</li><li>Editing tools for all network elements including those of the DT (add, delete, move, edit vertices and nodes, reverse links, multiple selection, etc.)</li><li>Tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default value allocation to newly created elements</li><li>Property editors for all model and DT component attributes, calculation options and default values</li><li>Automatic interpolation of node elevations from DTM</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness from material and age of pipes</li><li>Conversion of roughness coefficients between different headloss formulas and unit systems</li><li>Visualization of multiple demands and quality sources as distinct layers and integrated editing of their properties along with those of the nodes</li><li>Powerful editors of curves, patterns, controls and rules</li><li>Validation anywhere of model properties against typical data entry errors</li><li>Load of demands to service connections from the meter readings, and move them to the closest nodes</li><li>Optional integration of service connections into the model</li><li>Demand scenarios management by importing/exporting files</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic sectors and demand zones</li><li>Model simulation by using the EPANET toolkit 2.2</li><li>Visualization of simulation results by means of tables, color coded layers, arrows and floating or static labels</li><li>Automatic creation of legends and symbols for the results (customizable  with QGIS tools)</li><li>Time Browser to display simulation results</li><p align="justify">In order to improve the computing time, QGISRed uses binary libraries developed in .net, which constitutes the core of the GISRed standalone application.</p><p align="justify">The QGISRed plugin is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/research/research-groups/hydraulic-networks-and-pressurised-systems.html">REDHISP</a> Research Group of the Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (<a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/">IIAMA</a>) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, <a href="http://www.upv.es/index-en.html">UPV</a> (Spain), led by Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Martinez_Alzamora">Fernando Martínez Alzamora</a>.
