about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a freeware QGIS plugin developed to assist in building and analyzing hydraulic models of water distribution networks of any complexity, up to the level of detail required by Digital Twins. The plugin works seamlessly with QGIS which enables the user to georeference all network elements, use geographic background layers, edit graphical and alphanumeric data, use geoprocessing tools, visualize data by layers, customize the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed relies on an easy-to-use relational database of SHP and DBF files based on the EPANET data model, which has been extended to add new capabilities. Starting from the EPANET data model significantly reduces the learning curve.</p><p align="justify">In fact, the previous skills required on QGIS are minimum because QGISRed provides numerous tools to help building hydraulic models, to manage demand scenarios and to analyze the results without the need to use the QGIS environment, such as:</p><li>Project manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Automatic creation of new empty projects</li><li>Creation of a project backup</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files</li><li>Import basic network components from Shapefiles and other auxiliary components managed by the Digital Twin (DT) such as service connections, isolation valves and sensors.</li><li>Automatic generation of topological relationships between all the network elements</li><li>Graphical editing tools for all network elements including those of the DT (add, delete, move, edit vertices and nodes, reverse links, multiple selection, etc.)</li><li>Tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default values to newly created elements</li><li>Property editor for all model and DT component attributes, analysis options and default values</li><li>Complete editor of analysis options and default values</li><li>Automatic calculation of pipe lengths from the coordinates of the vertices</li><li>Automatic interpolation of node elevations from DTM</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness from material and age of pipes</li><li>Conversion of roughness coefficients between different headloss formulas and unit systems</li><li>Visualization of multiple demands and quality sources as distinct layers and edition of its properties integrated with those of nodes</li><li>Automatic nodal demand allocation from punctual or sectorial consumptions</li><li>Managing scenarios with multiple demands by category</li><li>Automatic pattern and hydraulic efficiency allocation by sector</li><li>Scenario builder for various model parameters by importing/exporting files</li><li>Demand scenarios management by importing/exporting files</li><li>Powerful editors for curves, patterns, controls and rules</li><li>Validation anywhere of model properties against typical data entry errors</li><li>Load of demands to service connections from the meter readings, and move them to the closest nodes</li><li>Management of service connections and isolation valves as differentiated elements</li><li>Detection of isolated zones when closing the isolation valves and canceling the demands on them</li><li>Optional integration of service connections into the model</li><li>Declaration of the meter sensors as distinct elements and the association of signals to them</li><li>Reading field data for the simulation period from files and export to EPANET</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic sectors and demand zones</li><li>Model simulation by using the EPANET toolkit 2.3</li><li>Visualization of simulation results by means of tables, color coded layers, arrows and floating or static labels</li><li>Automatic creation of legends and symbols for the results (customizable  with QGIS tools)</li><li>Navigation bar to display simulation results</li><p align="justify">Nevertheless, in case the user decides to use the QGIS tools to edit the data, QGISRed provides powerful facilities to detect potential editing errors before simulating the model, or to fill in the missing information.</p><p align="justify">The development of the new QGISRed plugin is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/research/research-groups/hydraulic-networks-and-pressurised-systems.html">REDHISP</a> Research Group of the Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (<a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/">IIAMA</a>) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, <a href="http://www.upv.es/index-en.html">UPV</a> (Spain), led by Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Martinez_Alzamora">Fernando Martínez Alzamora</a>. Its implementation was carried out up to 2022 by the <a href="https://waterpi.com/">WaterPi</a> company under the direction of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nestor_Lerma">Néstor Lerma</a>, PhD Eng.</p><p align="justify">The QGISRed extension for QGIS is an update of the old GISRed application developed by our group for the ArcView 3.1 environment (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336170857_Upgrade_of_the_GISRed_application_for_the_free_analysis_of_WDN_under_GIS_environment">see launching paper</a>).

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=version 0.17:
      * Incompatibilities with the latest versions of QGISRed, up to 3.44, have been resolve
      * Replacement of version 2.2 of the EPANET Toolkit with the new version 2.3
      * New exploration tool to identify isolated segments, highlighting affected manual valves and service connections
      * Display of up to 13 statuses for pipes, valves and pumps in the results
      * Transfer of statuses and qualities for chaining successive simulations

      * New options for resetting roughness, elevations and diameters in the scenario builder
      * New option to export and import scenarios in Epanet format


      * Projects listed in the Project Manager can now be temporarily reordered by attributes by clicking on headers
      * New options in the Project Manager to Rearrange, Export, Delete and Rename projects
      * New tab in the Import dialog to import projects from QGISRed
      * New buttons and menu options for opening and saving projects
      * The path of the .qgz file is now stored as a relative path in the metadata.txt file
      * If the associated .qgz file  is not found when opening a QGISRed project, the option to search for it is now offered it.
      * When opening a .qgz project directly from QGIS, if it is a QGISRed project, it is automatically added to the Project Manager.

      * Changes to the icons and names of some menu options
      * Changes in symbols used for some elements: nodes with demands, multiple demands, emitters and quality sources
      * The layers in the Input group are now automatically reordered
      * The number of elements contained in each layer is now displayed next to its name
      * All elements now display their ID when the mouse is hovered over them.

      * The precision when entering certain numerical values in shapes has been improved
      * The message when downloading the necessary dependencies have been reviewed
      * The ‘metadata.txt’ file now always closes when opened from the About dialog

      * The default tolerance when creating a project or importing shapes is now 0, to avoid strange behaviour in WGS84 coordinates.
      * Removed the default creation of the Signals.dbf file when creating a new project.
      * Removed the unexpected creation of the Service Connection theme when performing some graphic editing operations.
      * Extended the curve plots of pumps declared by 3 points to the entire quadrant.
      * If the material of a pipe is declared and the installation date is omitted, its roughness is determined as if it were new.

      * Fixed a bug that prevented adding pumps and valves on nodes with a connectivity degree of two
      * Fixed a bug when displaying the default modulation curve in the pattern dialog, and when declaring or modifying it in the analysis options.
      * Fixed a bug in storing the installation date of shut-off valves

      * Fixed bug in interpolating elevations when the point falls on one of the ends of the mesh.

      * Pump and valve ends are excluded in all options when assigning demands to nodes from the Nodal Demand Builder or from Service Connections.
      * Fixed a bug that prevented demands from being superimposed on the same node when assigning Punctual Consumptions from the Nodal Demand Builder.
      * Fixed bug when loading demands from a sector layer

      * Fixed a bug that confused the price pattern with the speed pattern when reading the INP file
      * Fixed bug when importing INPs with sources without defined pattern
      * Fixed bug when importing INPs related to Times and Temporary Rules
