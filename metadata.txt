about=<p align="justify">QGISRed is a freeware QGIS plugin developed to assist in building hydraulic models of water distribution networks. The plugin works seamlessly with QGIS which enables the user to georeference all network elements, use geographic background layers, edit graphical and alphanumerical data, use geoprocessing tools, visualize data by layers, customize the symbology, etc.</p><p align="justify">QGISRed relies on an easy-to-use relational database of SHP and DBF files based on the EPANET data model. In case the user decides to use the QGIS tools to edit the data, QGISRed provides powerful facilities to detect potential editing errors before simulating the model, or to fill in the missing information.</p><p align="justify">In addition, QGISRed provides numerous tools to help build and analyze models, such as:</p><li>Scenario manager for easy project loading and storage</li><li>Creation of new empty scenarios</li><li>Import/export EPANET INP files and external Shapefiles</li><li>Automatic generation of topological relationships between network elements</li><li>Tools for adding or deleting valves and pumps and for moving network nodes (new in v.0.8)</li><li>Topology tools to debug the network layout and verify its connectivity</li><li>Default value allocation to newly created elements</li><li>Property editors for all element attributes, calculation options and default values (new in v.0.8)</li><li>Automatic interpolation of node elevations</li><li>Automatic estimation of pipe roughness</li><li>Editing of multiple demands and quality sources integrated in the properties of the elements, and their visualization as separate layers (new in v.0.8)</li><li>Powerful editors of curves, patterns, controls and rules</li><li>Validation anywhere of model properties against typical data entry errors</li><li>Auxiliary elements handling such as isolation valves, service connections, hydrants, washout valves, flowmeters, pressure sensors, etc.</li><li>Optional integration of some of these auxiliary elements into the model</li><li>Automatic identification of hydraulic sectors and demand zones</li><li>Model simulation by using the EPANET toolkit</li><li>Visualization of simulation results by means of tables, color coded theme layers, arrows and floating or static labels</li><li>Automatic creation of legends and symbols for the results (changeable with QGIS tools)</li><li>Time Browser to display simulation results</li><p align="justify">In order to improve the computing time, QGISRed uses binary libraries developed in .net, which constitutes the core of the GISRed standalone application.</p><p align="justify">The QGISRed plugin is an initiative of the <a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/research/research-groups/hydraulic-networks-and-pressurised-systems.html">REDHISP</a> Research Group of the Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (<a href="https://www.iiama.upv.es/iiama/en/">IIAMA</a>) of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, <a href="http://www.upv.es/index-en.html">UPV</a> (Spain), led by Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Martinez_Alzamora">Fernando Martínez Alzamora</a>.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=version 0.8:
      * Editing properties of the main elements through a dialog window, being able to navigate from it through the different elements contained in the model.
      * Insertion/Elimination of valves and pumps in pipes. In the first case, by clicking on a point in the pipe, the pipe will be split or shortened (whichever the case may be) to introduce the new element. In the second case, by clicking on the valve or pump element, it will be eliminated by joining the adjacent pipes if possible.
      * Editing the network layout, being able to move nodes of the model so that the rest of the connected elements also move accordingly. 
      * Rearrangement of all the buttons of the plugin in 5 categories to facilitate the handling of the different options.
      * Correction of some bugs as control rules are read.
      * Dialogs for editing analysis options and default values.
      * Verification of repeated Ids during their generation.
      * Hiding of legend data tables (Patterns, Curves, Controls, Rules, Options and Default Values).
      * Changes in the results selection menu to show a single variable per node or per line. Reduction of refresh time.
      * Option to visualize the value of the chosen parameter for each element by using static labels.
      * Elimination of administrator permissions to install the necessary dependencies.
      * Some improvements on the features already offered in previous versions.
